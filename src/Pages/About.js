        retrieved from the New York City Police Department between the years 2006 and 2020 
        across different city jurisdictions. We worked with a dataset with over 5 million 
        entries containing the location of the crime, type of crime and perpetrator descriptions."

        crime activity since the data comes directly from NYPD. Any biases or inconsistencies are
